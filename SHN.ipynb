My take is that intelligence follows a distribution curve for which graders at any decent college are only able to effectively evaluate the upper quartile, minus the top 1 or 2 percent.  If you happen to be pushing the top 1 or 2 percent, you either have to lower yourself to the level of your graders or write your best thoughts and expect to receive less than the best grades for them.   If you follow the first track, you can expect the usual laurels for 'achievement.'   If you follow the second, you can expect to increase your intelligence at a higher rate, which may (or may not) have some payback later on.                      \n",

For instance, the typical university has undergraduate students, graduate students, professors and administrators.  One could simply say that there are four tiers.  The reason that we don't think of it this way is most of these institutions have grown up organically over time, or at the very least we aren't aware of the original design decisions.   Now I'm not arguing that we should necessarily replicate real-world institutions in online form, but one should at least recognize that real-world institutions (like universities) provide various measures which enforce content quality.   As for approximating real discussion, I'm not sure exactly what you mean.  There are many different types of real discussion, from idle conversation about sports to academic journals about the poetry of W.B. Yeats.  Although certain similar principles apply, the way in which you would model either of these would have to be different.   I'm afraid I also don't understand what you mean by an arbitrarily-tiered system.  Are you arguing in favor of the reddit model?\\n</td>\n",

Even if some subset of the population is going to lose the Jesus bit doesn't it make more sense to keep the name of the holiday the same?  For instance, if you are going to send out holiday well wishes (which I appreciate, I also upmodded the original poster) and going to send them out at a specific time (for example, Dec. 25) doesn't it make sense to refer to the holiday as 'Christmas' ? In my own limited personal campaign of holiday well-wishes, I usually end up only wishing Christmas greetings to people I know are Christians, sending more general holiday greetings to others at a time other than Christmas.  In conclusion, my contention is that if you are going to send your greeting on Christmas, you might as well call it a Christmas greeting.  If you send it Dec. 20, or 27, then maybe a holiday greeting.</td>\n",

Each account has karma (natural numbers), but the exact of karma is invisible to all except the administrator.  There is a karma meter which displays karma as a color gradient with different levels assigned different colors.  Content rating is done on a color gradient, from white to blue. Blue is good, white is bad, light blue would be okay.  Only members can rate content. Rating would be also be weighted according to the karma of the person doing the rating. In other words, members with more karma would give (or take away) more karma per rating. Each post would receive a default rating based on the karma of the poster, which would display as a color on the white to blue spectrum already described.  The color would change as people rate the content.   Not only comments, but also threads could have ratings on a similar basis. This would allow people to set up certain filters so they would view threads with a certain content rating.  Probably a person could automatically become a member when they pass some arbitrary karma threshold. What do you think about this?  Are you already working on something 'tolerable'?  \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Your algorithm suggestion is interesting, but probably not sufficient.  Although reddit trolls are one step up from internet spammers, the same principle applies.  With sufficient quantity of trolls/spammers blocking each one individually becomes an incredibly time intensive task - enough to drive away all those who don't have tons of time on their hands. Pg speaks above about customs, but the problem with customers have to both (1) be educated about site customs (2) want to be educated about site customs.  I think with any influx of 14 year olds of sufficient you will find both 1 &amp; 2 problematic. Now, personally, I think there is a significant difference between a news aggregation site and a community site.  In a community site persons actually develop relationships and relate to each other on this basis.  I have no seen that happen much on reddit or here.  One reason for this is the speed of discussion - most of the best online discussions I have been involved with have taken days or weeks to fully develop.  In any news-blog-digg driven site the time frame is closer to 24 hrs. What I would favor is a multi-tiered system.  For something like YC News there could be something like three tiers: (1) Old school hackers with experience in startups (2) Less experienced coders (3) Whoever wants to participate.  Each conversation could be assigned a tier, and people of that tier and above tiers could participate.  For example, a tier 3 discussion would accommodate people of tier 1,2 &amp;3, a tier 2 discussion could accommodate tiers 1&amp;2. In many ways this model is what we already do.  We have low-tier sites like digg which we may check, we come to places like this for a free form discussion mostly among people of type 2, and type 1 discussions are mainly engaged in via email.  So in some ways the only innovation I propose is that some of these type 1 discussions be viewable to the public, so we can see what cool lisp hackers talk about in private (and solicit them for advice). Response to other reddit comment comments: Fallacy - I don't think the fallacy thing will work simply because (as with the site customs described above) one has to be educated as to what any  given fallacy means. Ethical dilemma - funny I never thought of doing that, although I think your solution would work. Popular comments - yes this is a big problem; I have noticed it. \\n</td>\n",

As he says, there is value simply in doing the thought experiments of philosophy even when this does not lead towards any greater knowledge of truth.  In theory, this should allow one to greater appreciate what one does NOT know, which could (and, in my view, should) make one more humble. However, part of the problem of philosophy is it occasionally makes truth claims about the nature of its work and designs.  This most philosophy profs to teach it as if it is a science, which it is not.  If one viewed the ramblings of philosophers as more akin to the musings of the great poets presumably there could be greater appreciation all around.   Still, there must be selectivity of some sort.  With PG, I also wouldn't advise anyone to read through the collected works of Berkeley. Russell's history unfortunately also isn't great, although, IMHO, it is worth reading.</td>\n",

Counseling programs vary with the school.   Schools which frequently send kids to the ivies (or ivy-equiv) tend to have lots of experience with the process.  My public school had only a small amount.  Some have none (and don't even know when one of their students has beaten the odds and made their way into such a school).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4   Speculating on a causal principle implies that there is causality in the universe.

       "6   'Profit' is usually defined as pecuniary benefit.  PG has stated elsewhere that he is not particularly concerned about this.   In my charitable estimation, PG's \"Not a charity\" statement means that YC is not in the business of giving out financial handouts.  It does not mean that PG's first or only motive is pecuniary benefit. We live in a culture defined by the worship of the Almighty dollar.  If PG is at least hinting in a different direction, I'd say that's a good thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "8   I wrote two papers on Kant in uni, neither of which received an A.   My take is that intelligence follows a distribution curve for which graders at any decent college are only able to effectively evaluate the upper quartile, minus the top 1 or 2 percent.  If you happen to be pushing the top 1 or 2 percent, you either have to lower yourself to the level of your graders or write your best thoughts and expect to receive less than the best grades for them.   If you follow the first track, you can expect the usual laurels for 'achievement.'   If you follow the second, you can expect to increase your intelligence at a higher rate, which may (or may not) have some payback later on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "10  Speaking from someone who attended one, it is very easy to go to an Ivy League school and not excel simply because you (and everyone else there) are assumed to excel because you attend one.   As a point of a comparison take China.   China's most acclaimed school Peking University is fiendishly difficult to get into but gives a ridiculously easy education once you are there.  Still, Peking U grads are able to go most places they want.  Schools with a science/math/engineering focus seem to do better at maintaining a higher standard, but their students frequently come out looking like they just popped out of a cookie-cutter - not even a hint of an independent idea.

Do you think JS-browser integration as it currently exists is powerful enough for the stuff you are talking about?\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "16  I think there must be a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches.  Pure art or math might be top-down (McCarthy).  You might be more of a bottom-up person.   Or did McCarthy create LISP from tinkering with code and seeing the inadequacies in what already existed?

       "21  I disagree that we don't think in tiers in real life.  We do - except they are called roles or titles.  For instance, the typical university has undergraduate students, graduate students, professors and administrators.  One could simply say that there are four tiers.  The reason that we don't think of it this way is most of these institutions have grown up organically over time, or at the very least we aren't aware of the original design decisions.   Now I'm not arguing that we should necessarily replicate real-world institutions in online form, but one should at least recognize that real-world institutions (like universities) provide various measures which enforce content quality.   As for approximating real discussion, I'm not sure exactly what you mean.  There are many different types of real discussion, from idle conversation about sports to academic journals about the poetry of W.B. Yeats.  Although certain similar principles apply, the way in which you would model either of these would have to be different.   I'm afraid I also don't understand what you mean by an arbitrarily-tiered system.  Are you arguing in favor of the reddit model?\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "24  Actually, since I'm not celebrating the holiday in question either and am more to happy to argue on the Internet, here are my more extended thoughts.  Even if some subset of the population is going to lose the Jesus bit doesn't it make more sense to keep the name of the holiday the same?  For instance, if you are going to send out holiday well wishes (which I appreciate, I also upmodded the original poster) and going to send them out at a specific time (for example, Dec. 25) doesn't it make sense to refer to the holiday as 'Christmas' ? In my own limited personal campaign of holiday well-wishes, I usually end up only wishing Christmas greetings to people I know are Christians, sending more general holiday greetings to others at a time other than Christmas.  In conclusion, my contention is that if you are going to send your greeting on Christmas, you might as well call it a Christmas greeting.  If you send it Dec. 20, or 27, then maybe a holiday greeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

I don't think so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "26  Doesn't this come back to the problem of ontology?  Given the different possibilities, what makes you so sure SVG will come out on top?

This is especially true for Amazon, IMHO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "34  Here's one model I'd be interested in testing.  Three roles: basic, member, and administrator. Each account has karma (natural numbers), but the exact of karma is invisible to all except the administrator.  There is a karma meter which displays karma as a color gradient with different levels assigned different colors.  Content rating is done on a color gradient, from white to blue. Blue is good, white is bad, light blue would be okay.  Only members can rate content. Rating would be also be weighted according to the karma of the person doing the rating. In other words, members with more karma would give (or take away) more karma per rating. Each post would receive a default rating based on the karma of the poster, which would display as a color on the white to blue spectrum already described.  The color would change as people rate the content.   Not only comments, but also threads could have ratings on a similar basis. This would allow people to set up certain filters so they would view threads with a certain content rating.  Probably a person could automatically become a member when they pass some arbitrary karma threshold. What do you think about this?  Are you already working on something 'tolerable'?  \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "37  Just thinking off the cuff here, but couldn't one store a lisp-style list as a string in a relational database.  If I was using Ruby on Rails, I could simply build a simple lisp interpreter in Ruby to parse the string, then capture it as an in-memory tree.  This way I would only have active items in memory and could use some of the advantages of the standard web development platforms for whatever else I was doing.

       "42  Your algorithm suggestion is interesting, but probably not sufficient.  Although reddit trolls are one step up from internet spammers, the same principle applies.  With sufficient quantity of trolls/spammers blocking each one individually becomes an incredibly time intensive task - enough to drive away all those who don't have tons of time on their hands. Pg speaks above about customs, but the problem with customers have to both (1) be educated about site customs (2) want to be educated about site customs.  I think with any influx of 14 year olds of sufficient you will find both 1 & 2 problematic. Now, personally, I think there is a significant difference between a news aggregation site and a community site.  In a community site persons actually develop relationships and relate to each other on this basis.  I have no seen that happen much on reddit or here.  One reason for this is the speed of discussion - most of the best online discussions I have been involved with have taken days or weeks to fully develop.  In any news-blog-digg driven site the time frame is closer to 24 hrs. What I would favor is a multi-tiered system.  For something like YC News there could be something like three tiers: (1) Old school hackers with experience in startups (2) Less experienced coders (3) Whoever wants to participate.  Each conversation could be assigned a tier, and people of that tier and above tiers could participate.  For example, a tier 3 discussion would accommodate people of tier 1,2 &3, a tier 2 discussion could accommodate tiers 1&2. In many ways this model is what we already do.  We have low-tier sites like digg which we may check, we come to places like this for a free form discussion mostly among people of type 2, and type 1 discussions are mainly engaged in via email.  So in some ways the only innovation I propose is that some of these type 1 discussions be viewable to the public, so we can see what cool lisp hackers talk about in private (and solicit them for advice). Response to other reddit comment comments: Fallacy - I don't think the fallacy thing will work simply because (as with the site customs described above) one has to be educated as to what any  given fallacy means. Ethical dilemma - funny I never thought of doing that, although I think your solution would work. Popular comments - yes this is a big problem; I have noticed it. \\n   \n",

       "46  Russell can be read as a critique of PG.  As he says, there is value simply in doing the thought experiments of philosophy even when this does not lead towards any greater knowledge of truth.  In theory, this should allow one to greater appreciate what one does NOT know, which could (and, in my view, should) make one more humble. However, part of the problem of philosophy is it occasionally makes truth claims about the nature of its work and designs.  This most philosophy profs to teach it as if it is a science, which it is not.  If one viewed the ramblings of philosophers as more akin to the musings of the great poets presumably there could be greater appreciation all around.   Still, there must be selectivity of some sort.  With PG, I also wouldn't advise anyone to read through the collected works of Berkeley. Russell's history unfortunately also isn't great, although, IMHO, it is worth reading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "47  Yes, you're right.  I was thinking the same thing this afternoon as I was driving around.   However, one problem that continues to present itself is the cumulative nature of karma accretion.  Only if there is a completely separate scaling mechanism which determines vote weight independent of karma could be this avoided.   Otherwise even if an upmodder gets less for voting up PG (or Nostra) stories, they still get something.  \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
